Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.\nI hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited, but I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.\nI'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over.\nNever mind, I'll find someone like you, I wish nothing but the best for you, too.\nDon't forget me, I beg, I remember you said, 'Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.'\nYou know how the time flies, only yesterday was the time of our lives.\nWe were born and raised in a summer haze, bound by the surprise of our glory days.",
